        This project is a responsive journalling app that asks users a daily
        question and presents previous answers back to them in various ways.
        This was a team project that was the culmination of all of the skills we
        had learned on the course at
        <a href="https://northcoders.com/">Northcoders</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a link to the
        <a href="https://github.com/ejhall78/memory-box">Github repo</a>
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        As a team, we decided to push ourselves and learn some new tech for our
        project. With only around 10 days to code the entire app, we had to
        learn Svelte (with SvelteKit) and Firebase. We also used TypeScript
        throughout the app
      </p>
      <p>
        We initially wanted to use Svelte-Native with NativeScript but during
        the spiking phase of our project, we found that unfortunately we
        couldn't get it to work on our machines for various reasons
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we got through some teething issues setting up a connection to our
        Firestore database, we found the development experience with Svelte to
        be very enjoyable. I hope that it is the future of web-development
        (compilers vs virtual DOM) and it gains more support in the future
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with the team I worked with on this project was a great
        experience which I will remember fondly
      </p>
      <p>
        Working as a team of 4, we needed to learn some soft skills to ensure
        smooth development of out app. Such skill include:
        <strong> Husky & esLint</strong> (to help reduce merge conflicts),
        <strong>Kanban boards</strong> (we used Trello),
        <strong>Figma</strong> (for wire framing),
        <strong>daily stand-ups</strong>, <strong>pomodoro timers</strong> (for
        productivity) and a mix of <strong>solo / pair programming</strong> &
        <strong>mob de-bugging</strong>
      </p>
